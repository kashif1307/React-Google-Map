Documentation for index.js

'index.js' file runs the Google Map element needed in this program. 

Code wrapped with <div> displays the heading of "Current Location" and then shows the legend (the pins and their respective meanings).

The <Map> wrapping makes use of the Google Map component, first requiring GoogleMapURL along with an operational API Key to
build a cross-platform URL to launch Google Maps and perform searches, get directions and navigation, and display map views and panoramic images.

Loading element refers to the element which is getting rendered until Google Maps library is finished loading.

containerElement controls the borders and size of the displayed map.

mapElement is in charge of rendering the map component on the display outlet.

center represents the centered location at which the map renders.

zoom controls the quantity at which the map is zoomed.

Prelocation includes latitude and longitude along with a given ID (as a good practice) to be fed into the places array in Maps.js
which adds the marker to the pinpointed locations.
